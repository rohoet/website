Hello out there - I'm Robert - Welcome to my homepage.

I like exploring technologies and using them to help anyone making our presence more sustainable with a lower carbon footprint on our planet.
After working in various domains like automotive and logistics, I identified the energy business as the most suitable one for my ambitions and passion.
On my way to E.ON Digital Technology, where I currently work as an engineering lead, I was lucky to work with and learn from outstanding people in various roles such as full-stack developer, senior consultant, delivery manager, or technical product owner.
Some of the projects I worked on include open-source software, e.g., <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/app4mc/" target="_blank"> Eclipse App4mc</a> <!--[Eclipse App4mc](https://www.eclipse.org/app4mc/), --> or <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/" target="_blank"> Eclipse Kuksa</a> <!--[Eclipse Kuksa](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/) -->
(Automotive, IoT, & Cloud).
The various commercial projects I was involved with primarily addressed webservices using Java, Kotlin, C#, and Typescript.

In my private life, I like to spend time with my family, do various types of sports, play music, or like programming stuff for my smart home. 
For the latter, I run a couple of docker containers with Grafana, InfluxDB, Prometheus, Portainer, EVCC, Gitlab, Node-Red, IoBroker, PiHole, MQTT, Cadvisor, Node Exporter, and zibee2mqtt. 
These technologies help me with energy management across my 12,8kWp PV, my 5kWh battery, and all my smart and electric devices and sensors.
One of my favorite applications is an NS-Panel that I installed as a replacement of our floor heating thermostat. Klick [here]({{< ref "/posts/post03" >}}) for some pictures (kudos to <a href="https://docs.nspanel.pky.eu" target="_blank">jobr99</a>).

Eventually, I will update this website with more information. 
Until I put this information together, I leave you with my CV.
I am currently working on several energy management topics including ISO50005 or ISO50001.
